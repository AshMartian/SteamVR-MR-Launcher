# SteamVR - MR Launcher

This repo contains a basic launcher app written (poorly) in C# that adds a SteamVR Launcher to 3D Space within Windows Mixed Reality.

> **Note:** This App is built with no copyright infringement intended, is open-source and offered free-of-charge. 

## Installation

Run Supplied .appxbundle file and the app will appear as a Program within the Cliff House start menu. After selecting, it should place a 3D object in the Cliff House that launches SteamVR when interacted with.


## Why does this exist?

Currently, there is no way to launch SteamVR from Mixed Reality without using the desktop control window. This is a quick, easy solution to a simple, yet annoying, problem.
